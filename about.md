I am Antonis Maronikolakis, a 2nd-year PhD student at the LMU studying under the supervision of Hinrich Sch√ºtze. I am currently working on social and ethical NLP with a focus on hate speech analysis. As part of the [AI4Dignity](https://www.ai4dignity.gwi.uni-muenchen.de/) project, I am working with marginalized communities around the globe for collection and annotation of hateful data. Previously, I investigated multilinguality in BERT, publishing two papers on the subject.

You can find my (out-of-date) resume [here](https://antmarakis.github.io/files/antonis_resume.pdf).

In my free time, I like reading, writing, art and all things theatrical. The only exercise I get comes in the form of river-jumping and football.
